# 🧠 Intelligent Context-Aware Information System

> A sophisticated retrieval and generation system that intelligently routes queries and guarantees high-quality, factual responses through multi-stage verification

![System Architecture](https://github.com/username/repository/raw/main/images/system_architecture.png)

## 🌟 Overview

This Context-Aware Information Retrieval and Generation (CAIRG) system represents an advanced approach to knowledge access that dynamically routes user queries to optimal information sources. By combining domain-specific knowledge with external search capabilities, the system delivers accurate, comprehensive answers while maintaining factual integrity through multiple verification stages.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Query Dispatch**: Automatically determines the best information source based on query content
- **🔄 Multi-tier Verification Pipeline**: Multiple validation steps ensure accurate, relevant responses
- **📈 Self-Enhancement Capabilities**: Reformulates queries when initial results are inadequate
- **📊 Comprehensive Quality Control**: Validates both content relevance and answer accuracy
- **🔀 Dynamic Process Orchestration**: Adapts workflow paths based on content quality assessments

## 🛠️ System Architecture

The system builds upon LangGraph to orchestrate a sophisticated decision flow:

1. **Intent Analysis**: Routes questions to appropriate information sources
2. **Data Acquisition**: Fetches relevant data from knowledge base or web
3. **Relevance Verification**: Ensures retrieved information relates to the query
4. **Answer Synthesis**: Produces comprehensive answers from validated sources
5. **Quality Assurance**: Confirms response accuracy and completeness

## 📋 Components

### Domain Knowledge Repository

A specialized vector-based knowledge index containing:
- Technical blog posts on AI topics
- Semantically chunked for context preservation
- Embedded using high-quality vector representations

### Core Processing Units

- **Query Director**: Routes questions based on content analysis
- **Content Validator**: Filters information for relevance
- **Answer Synthesizer**: Creates comprehensive responses
- **Accuracy Validator**: Verifies factual correctness
- **Query Enhancer**: Reformulates questions for better retrieval

### External Knowledge Integration

- Seamless integration with web search APIs
- Real-time information for current events and external knowledge
